  <h1>Artist Statement on FunnyMaze</h1>
  <h2>by Gabriel Ruiz</h2>
  <p>This project first began as a basic interactive sketch for my Professor, Alan Perry's, course on creative coding in 2021. When I started this course, I knew nothing about 
  coding, but now I can demonstrate at the very least enough skills to make a basic game. That is what I did on p5.js, I made a simple game inspired by a flash game, 
  the World's Hardest Game, that I would always play during school growing up. I'm still not an amazing coding artist, which is why I chose to work with this simplistic design. 
  However, I expanded on the simplicity, and attempted to make the sketch visually interesting. I would say I succeeded in doing so, and I created a working simple game.</p>
